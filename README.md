# Mapty
This is the app that was created alongside the Javascript course by Jonas Schmedtmann, it's used to keep track of exercise sessions by using a map to annotate the location and a form for
the specifics like duration, time, cadence or elevation gain. 
The user should be able to:
* Create new entries by clicking on the map and completing the form;
* See the various entries both on the map and the list on the left;
* Delete a single workout or wipe the entire list;
* Edit a workout and have the derative speed change in real time;
* Sort the list by time of creation, distance, duration or type
